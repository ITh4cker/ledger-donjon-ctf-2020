    Looks like the brand new picoHSM is online. We don't really know what this
    product is... Time to have a look, and see how far we can go! But first,
    have a look at the firmware binary we managed to steal.

    There are 10 boards available on the network at `picohsm.donjon-ctf.io`, on
    ports ranging from `8001` to `8010`. Try to pick one. All boards are exactly the
    same. You may not be alone trying to play. If connection fails, the
    equipment is probably already busy...

    We also know the admin resets and reflashes the boards every 15 minutes.
    
    Finally, we captured a photo of this equipment... you'll probably
    understand why this suffers poor performance...
